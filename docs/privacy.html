  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 12, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>BoomShell</strong> is a mobile application developed by <strong>3rd Alarm Media</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>BoomShell is designed to be fun, offline-friendly, and respectful of your privacy. We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>

    <li>Use GPS or track your location</li>
    <li>Collect device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
    <li>Access your contacts, photos, or files</li>

    <li>Gameplay analytics (e.g., high scores, app usage duration)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If this is enabled, it will be disclosed clearly within the app and can be opted out of.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect any data from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no app or service can guarantee 100% security.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
